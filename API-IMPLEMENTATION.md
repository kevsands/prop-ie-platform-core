# API Implementation Details

This document provides an overview of the API implementation for the PropIE AWS application.

## Architecture Overview

The API implementation follows a layered architecture:

```
UI Components → React Query Hooks → API Client → API Routes → Service Layer → Database
```

### Key Components

1. **Database Layer** - Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
2. **Service Layer** - Business logic and data access abstraction
3. **API Routes** - Next.js API routes for HTTP endpoints
4. **API Client** - TypeScript client for frontend-to-API communication
5. **React Query Hooks** - Frontend data fetching with React Query
6. **UI Components** - React components that consume data

## Technology Stack

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **API Client**: Custom TypeScript client
- **Data Fetching**: React Query
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema (Prisma)

The Prisma schema defines all entities and their relationships. Key models include:

- `User` - User accounts with roles and authentication
- `Development` - Property development projects
- `Unit` - Individual properties within developments
- `Sale` - Sales processes for units
- `Document` - Document management for all entities

### 2. Service Layer

The service layer provides the business logic for the application. Each service is responsible for a specific domain:

- `userService`: User management operations
- `developmentService`: Development project operations
- `unitService`: Property unit operations
- `salesService`: Sales process operations
- `documentService`: Document management operations

Services handle data validation, business rules, and database access.

### 3. API Routes

API routes are implemented using Next.js API routes in the `app/api` directory. Each entity has its own route handler with methods for:

- `GET`: Retrieve resources with filtering and pagination
- `POST`: Create new resources
- `PUT`: Update existing resources
- `DELETE`: Remove resources

Route handlers validate input, call the appropriate service methods, and format responses.

### 4. API Client

The API client provides a typed interface for interacting with the API endpoints. It's implemented in `lib/api.ts` and includes:

- Methods for all API operations
- TypeScript types for requests and responses
- Error handling with consistent error objects
- Helper functions for URL building and response parsing

### 5. React Query Hooks

React Query hooks provide a React-friendly way to interact with the API. They're implemented in `hooks/api-hooks.ts` and include:

- Hooks for all API operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Query invalidation for data consistency
- Caching and refetching
- Loading and error state management

### 6. Example Implementation

The `components/examples/DevelopmentList.tsx` component demonstrates how to use the React Query hooks in a real-world scenario, including:

- Fetching data with filters and pagination
- Handling loading and error states
- Performing mutations (delete operation)
- Optimizing rendering performance

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are implemented:

- `/api/users`: User management
- `/api/developments`: Development project management
- `/api/units`: Property unit management
- `/api/sales`: Sales process management
- `/api/documents`: Document management

Each endpoint supports standard REST operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with appropriate filtering and pagination.

## Testing

The API implementation includes integration tests for all endpoints. Tests are located in the `__tests__/api` directory and use Jest for testing. Mock services are used to isolate the route handlers from the actual services.

## Error Handling

The API implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Validation Errors**: Input validation with descriptive error messages
2. **Service Errors**: Business logic errors with appropriate status codes
3. **Database Errors**: Database-related errors with safe error messages
4. **API Client Errors**: Network and response parsing errors

Errors are returned with a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": {}  // Optional additional error details
  }
}
```

## Authentication and Authorization

The API implementation includes authentication and authorization:

1. **Authentication**: Next Auth for user authentication
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: User roles for authorization
3. **API Route Protection**: Middleware for protecting API routes
4. **Frontend Protection**: Protected routes for frontend pages

## Documentation

The API implementation includes comprehensive documentation:

1. **API Documentation**: Detailed documentation of all API endpoints
2. **Data Model Guide**: Guide to using the data model and API infrastructure
3. **Type Definitions**: TypeScript interfaces for all entities
4. **Integration Tests**: Examples of API usage in tests

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements for the API implementation:

1. **API Versioning**: Version control for API endpoints
2. **Rate Limiting**: Request rate limiting for API protection
3. **API Key Authentication**: API key support for external integrations
4. **WebSockets**: Real-time updates for collaborative features
5. **GraphQL**: Alternative GraphQL API for more flexible queries
