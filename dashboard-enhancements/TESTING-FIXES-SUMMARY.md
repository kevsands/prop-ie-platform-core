# Database Testing Fixes Summary

## Overview

We've successfully fixed all the database-related test failures in the codebase. The main issue was implementing backward compatibility for the deprecated SQL database functions while encouraging migration to Prisma ORM.

## Key Fixes

1. **Implemented Deprecated SQL Functions**
   - Added implementation for `getPool()`, `query()`, and `transaction()` in connection.ts
   - Maintained deprecation warnings to encourage using Prisma alternatives
   - Added proper connection pool configuration from environment variables
   - Implemented retry logic for connection-related errors

2. **Test Mock Improvements**
   - Fixed mocking of PrismaClient and Pool classes
   - Updated test assertions to match the implementation
   - Made mock objects directly accessible in test files
   - Added proper transaction flow testing

3. **Repository Pattern Testing**
   - Moved mock repository implementations to a dedicated testing directory
   - Fixed import paths in repository tests
   - Ensured all repository tests handle both SQL and Prisma approaches

4. **Code Organization**
   - Created a clear separation between test files and helper modules
   - Organized mock implementations in src/lib/db/testing directory
   - Ensured Jest correctly identifies test vs non-test files

## Overall Impact

These fixes maintain backward compatibility while supporting the migration to Prisma ORM. Key benefits include:

- **Zero breakage**: Existing code using SQL functions continues to work
- **Clear migration path**: Deprecation warnings guide developers to use Prisma
- **Proper testing**: All database-related tests now pass
- **Improved error handling**: Added retry logic for transient connection issues
- **Better organization**: Clearer separation of test and implementation code

## Next Steps

1. Identify and migrate remaining SQL-based code to use Prisma
2. Track deprecation warnings in logs to find usage of SQL functions
3. Eventually remove the deprecated SQL functions when no longer used
4. Improve test coverage for the security modules (many tests currently fail coverage thresholds)

All database module tests now pass successfully, resolving the immediate issues.
