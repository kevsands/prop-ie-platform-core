## Security Compliance Overview

The Prop-IE application implements a comprehensive security strategy following AWS best practices and industry standards for securing web applications. Our approach includes:

- Defense in depth with multiple security controls
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Automated security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline
- Continuous monitoring and incident response capabilities
- Secure coding practices and developer training

## Authentication & Authorization Controls

### User Authentication

- Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
- Secure password policies enforced (minimum length, complexity)
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Secure token handling with proper expiration
- JWT token verification for all authenticated endpoints

### Authorization Framework

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Least privilege principle applied to all roles
- Granular permissions for different user types
- Resource-level permissions
- Server-side authorization checks for all endpoints

### Session Management

- Secure session handling with proper expiration
- HTTPS-only cookies with Secure and HttpOnly flags
- Anti-CSRF token implementation
- Session invalidation on logout
- Automatic session timeout after inactivity

## Data Protection

### Data Encryption

- All data encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+
- All data encrypted at rest using AWS-managed keys
- S3 bucket encryption using SSE-S3
- DynamoDB table encryption
- RDS database encryption
- Secret management using AWS Secrets Manager

### Data Handling

- PII data minimization principles applied
- Personal data masked in logs (e.g., email addresses, names)
- Sensitive data never stored in client-side storage
- No sensitive data in URLs
- Proper data sanitization for all inputs and outputs

### Data Retention

- Automated data lifecycle management
- Clear data retention policies
- Secure deletion processes
- Backup encryption

## Network Security

### AWS WAF Implementation

Our AWS WAF configuration protects against:

- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- SQL injection attacks
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- Command injection
- Path traversal
- Malicious bot traffic
- DDoS attacks through rate limiting
- IP reputation filtering
- Geographic restrictions (when needed)

### Network Controls

- VPC with proper segmentation
- Security groups with least privilege
- Network ACLs for additional control
- Private subnets for backend resources
- Public access restricted to necessary endpoints only
- CloudFront CDN with proper security headers
- WAF protection for all endpoints
- API Gateway with proper throttling

## Application Security

### Secure Coding Practices

- Input validation for all user inputs
- Output encoding to prevent XSS
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Proper error handling without information disclosure
- Secure file handling
- Memory safe coding practices
- Regular dependency updates
- Code reviews with security focus

### Security Headers

All responses include the following security headers:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https://www.google-analytics.com; connect-src 'self' https://*.amazonaws.com https://*.amplifyapp.com https://www.google-analytics.com; font-src 'self'; frame-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; form-action 'self'; base-uri 'self'; upgrade-insecure-requests
```

### Vulnerability Management

- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular penetration testing
- Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Security bug bounty program
- Responsible disclosure policy
- Automated patch management

## Infrastructure Security

### AWS Security Best Practices

- AWS account security (MFA, strong passwords)
- IAM roles with least privilege
- Secure CloudFormation templates
- Infrastructure as code security scanning
- Regular security assessments
- AWS Config for compliance monitoring
- GuardDuty for threat detection
- CloudTrail for audit logging
- AWS Security Hub integration

### Container Security

- Docker image scanning
- Immutable containers
- No privileged containers
- Proper secrets management
- Regular patching

### CI/CD Security

- Pipeline security scanning
- Infrastructure validation
- Secrets management
- Secure deployment processes
- Separation of duties
- Blue/green deployments
- Automatic rollback capabilities

## Compliance Monitoring & Auditing

### Logging & Monitoring

- Centralized logging with CloudWatch Logs
- Log retention policies enforced
- Sensitive data redacted from logs
- Real-time alerting for security events
- Log analysis for security insights
- SIEM integration capabilities
- Regular log reviews

### Auditing

- Comprehensive audit trails
- User activity logging
- Administrative action logging
- Authentication event logging
- Resource access logging
- CloudTrail for AWS API activity
- Regular audit reviews

### Compliance Checks

- Automated compliance scanning
- AWS Config rules for compliance
- Regular compliance reviews
- Remediation processes for compliance issues
- Documentation of compliance findings

## Security Incident Response

A comprehensive incident response plan is in place, as documented in [SECURITY-INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md](SECURITY-INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md). Key aspects include:

- Incident detection mechanisms
- Incident classification framework
- Response team and responsibilities
- Containment procedures
- Eradication and recovery processes
- Post-incident analysis
- Communication plans
- Regular incident response drills

## Compliance Standards

The security controls in the Prop-IE application are aligned with the following standards and frameworks:

- OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- GDPR requirements for data protection
- AWS Well-Architected Framework (Security Pillar)
- CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
- SOC 2 security principles
