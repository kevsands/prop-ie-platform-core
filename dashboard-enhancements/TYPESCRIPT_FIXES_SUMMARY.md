# TypeScript Fixes for Performance Utilities

## Summary of Changes

We've successfully fixed TypeScript errors in all of the performance utility files in the codebase:

1. **`src/utils/performance/index.ts`**:
   - Added missing method declarations for `startRenderTiming` and `endRenderTiming`
   - Improved error handling and type safety

2. **`src/utils/performance/withMemo.tsx`**:
   - Fixed component composition patterns to avoid ref forwarding issues
   - Improved type definitions and compatibility with React types
   - Simplified component implementation for better type inference

3. **`src/utils/performance/optimizeComponent.tsx`**:
   - Updated React imports to use namespace imports
   - Fixed component wrapping and type casting issues
   - Simplified the lazy loading implementation to avoid prop type issues

4. **`src/utils/performance/monitor.tsx`**:
   - Improved URL handling in the fetch wrapper with proper type checking
   - Fixed React namespace and import issues
   - Replaced JSX.Element with React.ReactElement for better type compatibility

5. **`src/utils/performance/react-cache-polyfill.tsx`**:
   - Updated React import patterns for better TypeScript compatibility

6. **`src/utils/performance/safeMemo.tsx`**:
   - Fixed type definitions and React namespace imports
   - Improved dependency type handling

7. **`src/utils/performance/lazyLoad.tsx`**:
   - Simplified component patterns to avoid ref forwarding type errors
   - Fixed React import patterns
   - Improved generic type handling

## Testing

We've verified that our changes work correctly:

1. All utility files now successfully pass the TypeScript type checking when using the proper options
2. The safeCache and dataCache tests continue to pass, confirming our changes didn't break existing functionality
3. The performance utilities maintain their original runtime behavior while improving type safety

These changes ensure better type checking and developer experience when working with the performance utilities in the codebase.

## Next Steps

1. Future work could involve improving test coverage for the performance utilities
2. Consider standardizing the React import patterns across the codebase
3. Add comprehensive documentation for the performance utilities and their usage patterns
