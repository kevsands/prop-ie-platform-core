# PropIE AWS App Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PropIE AWS App. The strategy aims to ensure robust quality assurance through multiple testing layers, focusing on critical integration points between components and services.

## Testing Layers

### 1. Unit Testing (Jest)

Unit tests focus on isolated components and functions:

- **Components**: Test React components in isolation
- **Utilities**: Test helper functions, validators, and formatters
- **Hooks**: Test custom hooks with appropriate mocking

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- Coverage Target: 80% for critical modules
- Run Frequency: On every code change, PR creation

### 2. Integration Testing (Jest Enhanced)

Integration tests verify interactions between related components:

- **Component Integration**: Test parent-child component relationships
- **Context Integration**: Test components with context providers
- **Form Submission Flows**: Test full form validation and submission

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Framework: Jest + enhanced setup for integration
- Coverage Target: 70% of critical user flows
- Key Focus Areas: Auth flows, form submissions, data fetching patterns

### 3. End-to-End Testing (Cypress)

E2E tests validate complete user journeys through the application:

- **Critical User Flows**: Authentication, property browsing, customization
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Visual Regression**: Detect unintended UI changes

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Framework: Cypress
- Test Scope: Main user journeys across all roles
- Run Frequency: Daily on staging environment, pre-release

### 4. Security Testing

Security-focused tests ensure protection of user data and system integrity:

- **Authentication Tests**: Verify auth flows, session management, token handling
- **Authorization Tests**: Verify proper access controls
- **Input Validation**: Test against injection attacks
- **API Security**: Validate proper request validation and sanitization

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Framework: Jest with security-specific assertions
- Coverage: All auth and data submission flows
- Run Frequency: On security-related changes, weekly scans

### 5. Performance Testing

Performance tests measure and ensure optimal application speed:

- **Load Time Benchmarks**: Initial page load, navigation transitions
- **API Response Times**: Measure and set thresholds for API performance
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks in long-running sessions

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Framework: Lighthouse CI, custom performance test suite
- Metrics: Core Web Vitals, custom application metrics
- Run Frequency: Weekly, pre-release

## AWS Amplify Testing Strategy

### Mocking Strategy

To facilitate offline testing and CI/CD integration:

- **Mock Service Layer**: Create mock implementations of all Amplify service interfaces
- **Local Testing Utilities**: Develop helpers for simulating Amplify responses
- **Environment Configurations**: Test against different environment configurations

### Authentication Testing

Specific focus on AWS Cognito integration:

- **Sign-in Flows**: Test standard, MFA, and social provider flows
- **Token Management**: Verify proper handling of JWT tokens
- **Session Persistence**: Test session storage and retrieval
- **Error Handling**: Validate proper handling of auth errors

### Data API Testing

For AppSync and API Gateway interactions:

- **Query Testing**: Verify GraphQL queries function correctly
- **Mutation Testing**: Test create, update, delete operations
- **Subscription Testing**: Verify real-time updates
- **Error Handling**: Test network failures and service errors

## CI/CD Integration

Automated testing pipeline integrated with CI/CD:

- **PR Validation**: Unit and integration tests run on all PRs
- **Daily Builds**: Full test suite run on nightly builds
- **Release Gate**: Performance and security tests as release gates
- **Reporting**: Automated test reporting and trend analysis

### Pipeline Configuration

- **Fast Feedback**: Quick unit tests run first
- **Parallel Execution**: Run tests in parallel when possible
- **Failure Handling**: Clear failure categorization and reporting
- **Environment Management**: Isolated test environments for each build

## Test Maintenance Strategy

Practices to ensure sustainable test codebase:

- **Test Utilities**: Shared utilities for common testing patterns
- **Mocking Standards**: Consistent approach to mocking external dependencies
- **Test Data Management**: Centralized test data fixtures
- **Test Documentation**: Standards for writing meaningful test cases

## Reporting and Metrics

Measurement of testing effectiveness:

- **Coverage Reports**: Line, branch, and function coverage metrics
- **Test Execution Time**: Monitor and optimize test execution
- **Flakiness Tracking**: Identify and address inconsistent tests
- **Bug Escape Rate**: Track bugs that escaped testing
