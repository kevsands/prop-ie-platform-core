## Architecture Overview

The security architecture has been designed with the React Server Components (RSC) model in mind, properly separating client and server-side code while ensuring optimized performance and a seamless user experience.

### Components:

- **Client-side components**: Marked with `'use client'` directive, include real-time monitoring, interactive dashboards, and responsive UI elements
- **Server components**: Handle data fetching, initial state preparation, and server-side validation
- **Shared types and utilities**: Used by both client and server code to ensure type safety and consistent behavior

### AWS Amplify Integration:

- Uses the modular approach from AWS Amplify v6 (e.g., `import { signIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth'`)
- Implements server-side API access via the Amplify client
- Leverages AWS Cognito for authentication, MFA, and user management

## Client/Server Separation

### Client-Side Components (use client):
- `OptimizedSecurityDashboard.tsx`
- `SecurityMetricsChart.tsx`
- `ThreatVisualization.tsx`
- `SecurityTimeline.tsx`
- `MFASetup.tsx`
- All interactive UI components

### Server-Side Components:
- `/app/dashboard/security/page.tsx`
- Security data fetching utilities
- Initial state providers

### Shared:
- Type definitions
- Constants
- Utility functions

## Authentication and MFA

### AWS Amplify Authentication:

The authentication system has been updated to use AWS Amplify v6 modular imports:

```typescript
import {
  signIn,
  signUp,
  confirmSignUp,
  resetPassword,
  getCurrentUser,
  fetchUserAttributes,
  fetchAuthSession
} from 'aws-amplify/auth';
```

### MFA Implementation:

The Multi-Factor Authentication system works with the latest AWS Amplify v6:

- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) setup and verification
- SMS-based MFA option
- Recovery codes generation and verification
- Caching for improved performance
- MFA requirement based on user role

Usage example:
```typescript
import { MFAService } from '@/lib/security/mfa';

// Check if MFA is required for a user
const requiresMfa = MFAService.shouldEnforceMFA(user);

// Set up TOTP
const mfaSetup = await MFAService.setupTOTPMFA();

// Verify code
const verified = await MFAService.verifyTOTPSetupWithCode("123456");
```

## Security Analytics

The security analytics system has been split into client and server parts:

### Server-Side:
- `securityAnalyticsServer.ts`: Contains React Server Components-compatible functions with automatic caching
- Handles initial data fetching for dashboards
- Uses the `cache()` function from React for automatic request deduplication

### Client-Side:
- `securityAnalyticsClient.ts`: Provides real-time updates and interactive features
- Connects to server-sent events for live data
- Uses web workers for performance-intensive operations
- Implements sophisticated caching strategies

### Integration with Next.js App Router:

The server component loads initial data, which is then passed to the client component for hydration:

```typescript
// Server component
export default async function SecurityDashboardPage() {
  const securitySnapshot = await getSecuritySnapshot();
  
  return (
    <OptimizedSecurityDashboard 
      initialMetrics={securitySnapshot.metrics}
    />
  );
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

Several performance optimizations have been implemented:

1. **Component-level optimizations**:
   - Memoization with `useMemo` for expensive calculations
   - Performance monitoring with custom hooks
   - Lazy loading via dynamic imports and Suspense boundaries

2. **Data fetching optimizations**:
   - Multi-level caching (memory, persistent, and React cache)
   - Parallel data fetching with Promise.all
   - Intelligent refresh strategies based on active view

3. **Rendering optimizations**:
   - Server-side rendering for initial load
   - Component code splitting
   - Selective re-rendering with tracked dependencies

4. **Network optimizations**:
   - Batched API requests
   - Incremental loading of data
   - Data normalization to reduce payload size

## Integration Points

### Integration with Authentication Flow:

The security components integrate with the central authentication flow:

1. `AppSecurityProvider` wraps the application to provide security context
2. Authentication state changes trigger security monitoring updates
3. Security analytics correlate with authentication events

### Integration with User Management:

Security features connect with user management:

1. Role-based security enforcement
2. User-specific security settings
3. MFA requirements based on user role

## Testing and Verification

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Authentication flow**:
   - Verify login, logout, and session management
   - Test MFA challenges and recovery

2. **Security monitoring**:
   - Validate real-time event detection
   - Test threat alerting and notification

3. **Performance validation**:
   - Measure initial load time with and without server components
   - Verify memory usage patterns
   - Test under high data volumes

### Verification Checklist:

- All client components are properly marked with 'use client'
- Server components don't use browser-only APIs
- Component props are serializable for server/client boundary
- All AWS Amplify imports follow the v6 modular pattern
- Data fetching uses proper patterns for React Server Components

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced analytics**:
   - Integration with AWS CloudWatch metrics
   - Machine learning-based anomaly detection

2. **Additional security features**:
   - Device fingerprinting improvements
   - Additional authentication factors
   - Enhanced identity verification

3. **Performance optimizations**:
   - Further code splitting
   - Enhanced caching strategies
   - Web worker utilization improvements
