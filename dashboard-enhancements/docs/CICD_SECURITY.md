# CI/CD Security Implementation Guide

This document provides an overview of the CI/CD security measures implemented in this project to ensure secure development, testing, and deployment processes.

## Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks run automatically before each commit to catch security issues early in the development process.

### Configuration

Pre-commit hooks are configured in `.husky/pre-commit` and include:

- **Package Lock Verification**: Ensures package-lock.json integrity to prevent supply chain attacks
- **Security Linting**: Runs ESLint with security-focused rules
- **Suspicious Package Detection**: Checks for potentially malicious packages
- **SBOM Generation and Validation**: Creates and validates a Software Bill of Materials
- **Lint-staged Checks**: Verifies that staged code changes meet quality and security standards

### Adding New Hooks

To add a new security check to the pre-commit hook:

1. Create your script in the `scripts/` directory
2. Add the script execution to the `.husky/pre-commit` file
3. Ensure the script exits with a non-zero status for security issues

## GitHub Actions Workflows

GitHub Actions automate security scanning and ensure secure deployment practices.

### Security Scanning Workflow

The `security-scan.yml` workflow runs on:
- Push to main branches
- Pull requests to main branches
- Daily scheduled runs
- Manual triggers

It includes the following security checks:
- Package integrity verification
- SBOM generation and validation
- Suspicious package detection
- Security-focused ESLint rules
- Dependency scanning
- CodeQL analysis
- Snyk vulnerability scanning
- Container scanning (if Dockerfile exists)

### CodeQL Analysis

The `codeql-analysis.yml` workflow provides deeper static analysis:
- JavaScript and TypeScript static analysis
- Extended security query packs
- Weekly scheduled runs
- Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab

### Secret Management

The `secret-management.yml` workflow provides secure secret handling:
- Secret rotation
- Integration with AWS Secrets Manager
- OIDC authentication
- Verification that no secrets are hardcoded

## Secret Management

Secrets are managed following these principles:

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All secrets are stored in environment variables or secure vaults
2. **Least Privilege**: Services only have access to the secrets they need
3. **Regular Rotation**: Secrets are rotated on a regular schedule
4. **Audit Trails**: All secret access is logged and audited

### Secret Storage Locations

- **Development**: Environment variables in `.env.local` (not committed)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Secrets and Environment Variables
- **Production**: AWS Secrets Manager

## Security Scanning Tools

The project implements various security scanning tools:

1. **ESLint Security Plugins**:
   - eslint-plugin-security
   - eslint-plugin-react-security
   - eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized

2. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - npm audit
   - Snyk
   - SBOM validation

3. **Static Code Analysis**:
   - CodeQL
   - Suspicious pattern detection

4. **Secret Detection**:
   - Gitleaks
   - Custom pattern scanning

5. **Container Security**:
   - Trivy

## Implementation Guidelines

Follow these guidelines when implementing new security measures:

### Adding Security Checks

1. Document the purpose of the check
2. Provide clear error messages
3. Ensure low false-positive rate
4. Consider performance impact

### CI/CD Pipeline Modifications

1. Create a new GitHub Actions workflow or modify existing ones
2. Test workflows thoroughly before merging
3. Avoid putting sensitive information in workflow files
4. Use appropriate GitHub Permissions

### Incident Response

If a security issue is identified in the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Document the finding
2. Assess the impact
3. Fix the issue with a pull request
4. Update security tools to catch similar issues
