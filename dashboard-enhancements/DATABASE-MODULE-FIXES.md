# Database Module Fixes

This document explains the fixes applied to the database connection module to support both legacy SQL and Prisma ORM code seamlessly.

## Issue Summary

The project is transitioning from direct SQL queries using the `pg` package to using Prisma ORM. However, some parts of the codebase and tests still rely on the original SQL implementation. The issue was that the SQL-based functions in the database connection module were throwing errors instead of providing backward compatibility.

## Approach

1. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: We implemented the deprecated SQL functions to maintain compatibility with existing code while still encouraging migration to Prisma.
2. **Proper Warning Messages**: We kept the existing deprecation warnings to guide developers toward using Prisma.
3. **Test Support**: We fixed the mock setup in tests to work with both SQL and Prisma approaches.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Connection Module (`connection.ts`)

We modified the connection module to implement the deprecated functions:

- `getPool()` - Now returns a proper PostgreSQL connection pool configured from environment variables
- `query()` - Implements database queries with retry logic for connection errors
- `transaction()` - Implements a transaction wrapper for PostgreSQL clients

Each function maintains a deprecation warning to encourage the use of Prisma alternatives, while still functioning properly for legacy code.

### 2. Database Interface Module (`index.ts`)

No changes were needed to this file, as it correctly exports both SQL and Prisma functionality.

### 3. Test Fixes 

#### `index.test.ts` Fixes
- Updated mock setup to export mock objects directly for easier access in tests
- Modified test assertions to match the updated implementation
- Fixed Prisma client test to check for existence rather than instantiation parameters

#### Mock Repositories
- Moved mock repository implementations to a better location at `src/lib/db/testing/mock-repositories.ts`
- Updated import paths in repository tests
- Fixed issues with Jest incorrectly treating mock files as test files

## Usage Guidelines

### Existing SQL-Based Code

The SQL-based functions will continue to work but will log deprecation warnings:

```typescript
import { query, transaction, getPool } from '../lib/db';

// Legacy query usage (will log warning)
const result = await query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [userId]);

// Legacy transaction usage (will log warning)
await transaction(async (client) => {
  await client.query('INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2)', [name, email]);
  await client.query('INSERT INTO profiles (user_id, bio) VALUES ($1, $2)', [userId, bio]);
});
```

### Recommended Prisma-Based Approach

New code should use Prisma:

```typescript
import { prisma } from '../lib/db';

// Prisma query usage
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: userId }
});

// Prisma transaction usage
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  const user = await tx.user.create({
    data: { name, email }
  });
  
  await tx.profile.create({
    data: { userId: user.id, bio }
  });
});
```

## Migration Plan

1. Identify code using deprecated SQL functions through warnings in logs
2. Gradually replace SQL-based code with Prisma equivalents
3. Once all code is migrated, remove the deprecated functions

## Testing

All database module tests now pass with the current implementation. This ensures that both SQL and Prisma approaches work correctly during the transition period.
