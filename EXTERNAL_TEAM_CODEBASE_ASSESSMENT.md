## 🚨 Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Technical Debt Analysis (8.5/10 Critical)

**Monolithic Architecture Problems:**
- 90 service files averaging 674 lines each
- Largest service: 2,177 lines (PredictiveBuyerAnalyticsService)
- Cross-domain coupling throughout service layer
- Deployment risk from tightly coupled services

**AWS Vendor Lock-in:**
- 550 files with direct AWS Amplify imports
- Critical dependencies on Cognito, AppSync, S3, RDS
- Migration complexity: HIGH (6-8 months estimated)
- Technology stack flexibility: LIMITED

**Component Duplication:**
- 63 dashboard components (40% consolidation possible)
- 16 authentication files with parallel systems
- 30 manager pattern components (60% consolidation possible)

### 2. Development Coordination Issues

**Version Misalignment:**
- Ethan currently on commit `35ac090c` (9 commits behind)
- Missing recent API fixes and infrastructure improvements
- Risk of conflicting development efforts

**Team Scalability Constraints:**
- Monolithic codebase limits parallel development
- Shared services create merge conflicts
- Testing cycles 3x longer than necessary

│   ├── Extracts 7,766 lines of analytics code
│   ├── Enables technology diversification (Python/R)
│   ├── Scalable data processing
│   └── Real-time analytics capabilities
│
└── Workflow Service (8-10 weeks)
    ├── Professional coordination (58+ roles)
    ├── Task orchestration (8,148+ tasks)
    ├── Domain-specific optimization
    └── Independent scaling
```

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Modernization (2-4 months)
```typescript
AWS Decoupling Strategy:
├── Interface Abstractions (Database, Auth, Storage)
├── Container-based Deployment (Docker/Kubernetes)
├── Cloud-agnostic Infrastructure (Terraform)
├── Alternative Service Implementations
└── Migration Validation & Testing
```
