RECOMMENDATIONS BY PRIORITY:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- [Build] 2425 TypeScript errors preventing optimized build
  Action: Fix TypeScript errors to enable production optimizations

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- [Bundle Size] Large dependencies detected: lodash
  Action: Consider lighter alternatives or lazy loading

- [Deployment] No monitoring solution configured
  Action: Fix deployment configuration issue

- [Performance] Image optimization
  Action: Use next/image component for automatic image optimization

- [Performance] Font optimization
  Action: Use next/font for optimized font loading

LOW PRIORITY:
- [Performance] Bundle analysis
  Action: Install @next/bundle-analyzer to identify large modules

QUICK WINS:
1. Fix TypeScript errors to enable build optimizations
2. Remove unused dependencies
3. Add .env.example file
4. Configure monitoring solution
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline
6. Implement security headers
