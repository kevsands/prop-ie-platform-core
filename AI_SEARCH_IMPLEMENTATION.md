# AI-Powered Property Search Implementation

This document describes the enhanced AI-powered property search functionality implemented in the PropIE application.

## Overview

The enhanced property search page provides an AI-powered natural language search interface that connects to the existing development data in the system. It allows users to search for properties using natural language queries and provides relevant matches based on the query content.

## Files Modified

1. **src/app/properties/search/page.tsx**
   - Updated to use the enhanced search implementation
   - Now serves as a wrapper for the enhanced-page.tsx component

2. **src/app/properties/search/enhanced-page.tsx**
   - Main implementation of the AI-powered search
   - Includes natural language processing for property matching
   - Features three view modes: AI, grid, and list
   - Connects directly to the development data

3. **src/components/HomePage.tsx**
   - Updated search input to link to the enhanced search page
   - Added AI-focused placeholder text
   - Modified to use the Sparkles icon from Lucide React

4. **src/components/sections/HeroWithCarousel.tsx**
   - Updated search input to link to the enhanced search page
   - Added event dispatching for AI search queries
   - All search buttons now correctly link to the search page

## AI Matching Algorithm

The core of the AI search functionality is the `matchPropertiesWithAI` function, which:

1. Takes a natural language query and parses it to extract:
   - Location preferences
   - Price constraints
   - Number of bedrooms
   - Property type requirements
   - Feature requests

2. Assigns relevance scores to properties based on how well they match the query parameters

3. Returns properties sorted by relevance score

Example queries that work well:
- "3 bedroom house in Drogheda under 400k"
- "Apartment with balcony"
- "Family home with garden near schools"
- "Modern property with good energy rating"

## Integration with Development Data

The search functionality is fully integrated with the existing development data:

- Fitzgerald Gardens
- Ballymakenny View
- Ellwood

Properties are generated from the floor plans in these developments to provide a rich search experience. Each property links back to its parent development for a seamless user journey.

## Event-Based Communication

The implementation includes a custom event system to allow communication between components:

```javascript
// Dispatch an AI search event
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('ai-search', { 
  detail: { query: 'First-time buyer homes with good energy rating' }
}));

// Listen for AI search events
window.addEventListener('ai-search', handleAISearch);
```

This allows search queries initiated from the homepage or hero section to be processed by the enhanced search page.

## User Interface

The enhanced search page provides:

1. A prominent AI search input with the Sparkles icon
2. Example search suggestions
3. Multiple view modes (AI, grid, list)
4. Development shortcuts for quick navigation
5. Visual indicators for property status and features

The overall design matches the AI-powered banner shown on the homepage, providing a consistent user experience.
