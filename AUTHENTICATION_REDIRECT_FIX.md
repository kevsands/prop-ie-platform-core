# Authentication Redirect Fix

## Overview
Fixed the authentication flow to redirect developers to `/developer` instead of `/dashboard` after login.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Login Pages
- **`/src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`**: Modified to check user role and redirect accordingly
- **`/src/app/login/page.tsx`**: Updated to use session role instead of email patterns

### 2. Role-Based Routing
Developers now redirect to appropriate pages based on their role:
- `developer` → `/developer`
- `estate_agent` → `/agents`
- `solicitor` → `/solicitor`
- `admin` → `/admin`
- `buyer` → `/buyer` (default)

### 3. No Onboarding Flow (Per Request)
- Skipping onboarding for now
- Developers log in directly to `/developer` dashboard
- Onboarding can be added later

## How It Works

1. User registers with account type "developer"
2. User logs in with credentials
3. System checks session for user role
4. Automatically redirects to `/developer`

## Testing Instructions

1. Register a new developer account:
   - Go to `/auth/register`
   - Select "Developer" as account type
   - Complete registration

2. Log in:
   - Go to `/login` or `/auth/login`
   - Enter developer credentials
   - Should redirect to `/developer`

## Next Steps

Now that authentication is fixed, we can focus on:
1. Building out the developer dashboard functionality
2. Integrating Fitzgerald Gardens data
3. Creating unit management features
4. Implementing sales pipeline tools
