# Phase 1: AWS Foundation Assessment

## ✅ AWS Configuration Status

### Account Information
- **AWS Account ID**: 529088273166
- **User**: be-cli-user  
- **Region**: eu-west-1 (Ireland)
- **CLI Version**: 2.26.5

### Permission Issues Identified
- ❌ **Amplify Access**: User lacks `amplify:ListApps` permission
- ✅ **RDS Access**: Can list RDS instances (none found)
- ✅ **General AWS Access**: Basic IAM permissions working

## 🚨 Decision Point: Permission Strategy

### Option A: Request Additional Permissions
**Pros**: Full AWS Amplify access
**Cons**: May require admin intervention
**Time**: Unknown (depends on admin response)

### Option B: Alternative Deployment Strategy
**Pros**: Can proceed immediately
**Cons**: Different deployment approach needed
**Time**: Proceed now

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

Given the permission constraints, let's pivot to a **careful, validated approach**:

### Immediate Strategy (No AWS Changes Needed)
1. **Continue with RDS setup** (permissions appear sufficient)
2. **Create staging database locally first** for testing
3. **Test application with external database** before any cloud deployment
4. **Document findings** and plan permission request if needed

### Alternative Deployment Options
1. **Docker containerization** → Deploy to AWS ECS/Fargate
2. **Manual deployment** → Build locally, upload to S3 + CloudFront
3. **GitHub Actions** → CI/CD pipeline with appropriate AWS permissions
4. **Request Amplify permissions** → Wait for admin approval

## 🔧 Current Safe Actions (No Permissions Needed)
- ✅ Create local PostgreSQL database for testing
- ✅ Test application with external database connection
- ✅ Create Docker configuration for deployment
- ✅ Document deployment requirements for admin
- ✅ Build application locally and verify artifacts

## 📋 Phase 1 Revised Plan

**Goal**: Validate application with external database before requesting cloud permissions

1. **Set up local PostgreSQL** (instead of RDS immediately)
2. **Test staging configuration** with local external database
3. **Validate application works** with PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
4. **Document requirements** for AWS admin to grant appropriate permissions
5. **Create deployment artifacts** ready for when permissions are available

This approach is **slower but much safer** - we validate everything locally before touching cloud resources.

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Testing locally with PostgreSQL
- **Zero Cloud Cost**: No AWS resources created yet
- **Reversible**: Can switch back to SQLite anytime
- **Educational**: Learn deployment requirements before committing to cloud

**Recommendation**: Proceed with local PostgreSQL setup to validate staging readiness.
