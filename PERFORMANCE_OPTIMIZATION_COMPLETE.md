## 🎯 Technical Implementation

### 🗂️ Cache Architecture
```typescript
// Real-Time Cache Manager with Intelligent Features
const cached = await realTimeCacheManager.get<Property[]>(
  cacheKey,
  async () => {
    // Database fallback with real-time broadcasting
    return await realPropertyDataService.searchProperties(filters);
  },
  {
    ttl: 1 * 60 * 1000, // 1 minute TTL
    priority: 'high',
    invalidateOnUpdate: true,
    prefetchThreshold: 0.8
  }
);
```

### 🔗 Connection Pool Management
```typescript
// Enterprise Connection Pool with Load Balancing
export class ConnectionPoolManager extends EventEmitter {
  private connections: Map<string, PooledConnection> = new Map();
  private loadBalancing: 'round-robin' | 'least-connections' | 'random';
  
  async sendMessage(message: any): Promise<boolean> {
    const connection = this.getNextConnection(); // Load balanced
    return connection.ws.send(JSON.stringify(message));
  }
}
```

### 📈 Performance Optimization Service
```typescript
// AI-Powered Auto-Tuning
export class PerformanceOptimizationService extends EventEmitter {
  private async performAutoTuning(): Promise<void> {
    const insights = this.generatePerformanceInsights();
    if (insights.overallScore < 80) {
      await this.applyOptimizations(insights);
    }
  }
}
```
