# 10GB Codebase Assessment - Working Memory

## Assessment Timestamp
**Started**: 2025-06-21 09:35:00
**Location**: `/Users/kevin/backups/awsready_20250524`
**Total Size**: ~10GB across multiple project directories

## Directory Structure Overview

### Main Project Directories Identified
1. **prop-ie-aws-app/** - 3.5GB
2. **prop-ie-aws-app-PERFECT-WORKING-JUNE13-2025/** - 4.1GB  
3. **prop-ie-deploy-ready/** - 576MB
4. **prop-ie-platform-2025-06-15/** - 2.5GB
5. **Multiple worktree directories** - Various sizes

## Initial Analysis Summary

### Technology Stack Discovered
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **AWS Amplify v6** integration
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Enterprise-grade security** implementations
- **PostgreSQL/Supabase** database layers
- **Comprehensive testing** frameworks

### Key Findings So Far
1. **PERFECT-WORKING-JUNE13-2025** appears to be the most complete version
2. **prop-ie-aws-app** shows corruption history and safeguards
3. **Multiple .env files** with live credentials (security concern)
4. **Extensive documentation** across all versions
5. **Enterprise-grade features** - transactions, analytics, multi-tenant

### Security Observations
- Live Supabase credentials exposed in .env.local
- Multiple API keys and tokens in various .env files
- Comprehensive .gitignore needed before any commits
- AWS credentials and configurations present

## Assessment Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Working Memory (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Initial directory identification
- [x] Size assessment complete
- [x] Technology stack identified
- [ ] Complete structure mapping
- [ ] Timeline analysis

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis (PENDING)
- [ ] Package.json inventory
- [ ] CLAUDE.md comparison
- [ ] Environment file audit
- [ ] Git repository states
- [ ] Feature completeness matrix

### Phase 3: Strategic Recommendations (PENDING)
- [ ] Primary candidate selection
- [ ] Merge strategy development
- [ ] Archive recommendations
- [ ] Migration roadmap

## Critical Notes for Context Preservation

### File Corruption History
- **prop-ie-aws-app** experienced major corruption January 14-15, 2025
- Aggressive automated scripts corrupted 2,000+ files
- Backup files with timestamps show mass modifications
- Multiple dangerous scripts still present in /scripts/

### Enterprise Context
- **PROP.ie Platform** - Irish property technology platform
- **â‚¬847M+ annual transactions** processed
- **B2B2C ecosystem** comparable to Salesforce for real estate
- **1,354+ TypeScript files** in complete version
- **Multi-stakeholder platform** with comprehensive features

### Next Steps Required
1. Map complete directory structures
2. Analyze all package.json dependencies
3. Compare documentation across versions
4. Assess production readiness of each version
5. Create feature completeness matrix
6. Develop strategic merge/migration plan
