# Backup Files

This directory contains backup versions of components and code snippets from the main application. These files are stored for reference purposes only and are not meant to be directly imported or used in the application.

## File Format

All backup files have been renamed with a `.txt` extension, regardless of their original file type:

- `.tsx.txt` - TypeScript React components
- `.jsx.txt` - JavaScript React components
- `.ts.txt` - TypeScript files
- `.js.txt` - JavaScript files
- `.bak.txt` - Other backup files

This naming convention helps prevent TypeScript compiler errors and ensures these files are treated as plain text for reference purposes.

## Usage

If you need to reference or restore code from these backup files:

1. Copy the relevant code sections from the backup file
2. Paste into a new file in the appropriate directory within the main application
3. Ensure proper TypeScript/JSX compatibility

## TypeScript Compatibility

The original files may contain TypeScript/JSX syntax that requires proper TypeScript configuration. When copying code from these backup files into active components, ensure you place them in files with the correct extensions (`.tsx` for React components with TypeScript) and within directories that are properly configured in the project's `tsconfig.json`.
