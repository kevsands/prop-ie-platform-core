# TypeScript Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Naming Conflict in Tooltip Component**: Fixed syntax errors related to importing `Tooltip` from both 'recharts' and '@/components/ui/tooltip'.
   - Modified files:
     - `/src/app/developer/tenders/page.tsx`
     - `/src/components/finance/ProfitabilityAnalysis.tsx`
     - `/src/components/finance/ROICalculator.tsx`
   - Solution: Renamed the imported 'Tooltip' from recharts to 'RechartsTooltip' to avoid naming conflicts.

## Remaining Issues

While the application is now able to run, there are still TypeScript errors in the codebase that should be addressed:

1. **JSX Configuration Issues**: Many TypeScript errors are related to JSX configuration.
2. **Type Definition Issues**: Multiple errors from node_modules and library type definitions.
3. **Implicit Any Types**: There are many instances of parameters with implicit 'any' types.
4. **Property Access Errors**: Several errors for accessing properties that don't exist on objects.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Configuration**: Review and update the TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json`.
2. **Address Common Type Errors**: Systematically address the most frequent error types.
3. **Improve Code Organization**: Refactor code to improve maintainability and reduce dependency conflicts.
4. **Add Type Definitions**: Add proper type definitions where missing.

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Consistent Import Naming**: Establish consistent naming conventions to avoid conflicts.
2. **Type Safety**: Enforce stricter type checking with TypeScript.
3. **Code Reviews**: Implement code review processes that catch type errors before they reach the main branch.
4. **Automated Testing**: Add more automated tests to catch type-related issues early.
