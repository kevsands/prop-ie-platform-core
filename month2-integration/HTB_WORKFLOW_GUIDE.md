# HTB (Help to Buy) Manual Workflow for ROS.ie Integration

## üè† Help to Buy Scheme Integration Guide

**Context**: As confirmed by the user: *"there is no government api we are going to go on to ROS.ie and put in the detail manually, but we will manage each buyer through the portal as the developer. As the buyer they will get the claim code and access code and then we will claim the money and confirm it has happened"*
