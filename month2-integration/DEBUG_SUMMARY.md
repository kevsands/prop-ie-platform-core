# Debug Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **React Query Imports** ✅
   - Fixed import paths to use `@tanstack/react-query` v4 instead of mixed v4/v5 imports
   - Removed persistence features that were incompatible with v4

2. **Environment Variables** ✅
   - Verified .env and .env.local files are properly configured
   - Environment variables are accessible in the application

3. **Three.js Imports** ✅
   - Fixed namespace imports to use `* as THREE` pattern
   - Updated files to use `THREE.BoxGeometry` instead of named imports

4. **User Type Definitions** ✅
   - Fixed ambient context implementation error in user.ts
   - Converted getter methods to utility functions to comply with TypeScript interface rules

5. **Development Server** ✅
   - Server starts successfully on port 3000 (or 3001 if port 3000 is busy)
   - Created test page at `/test-debug` to verify app functionality

## Current Status

The application is now running with significantly fewer TypeScript errors. The development server starts successfully and basic pages are accessible.

## Remaining Issues

1. **Test File TypeScript Errors** - Mock type mismatches in test files (lower priority)
2. **CommonJS Module Exports** - Some modules may still have export issues (lowest priority)

## How to Verify

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/test-debug`
3. You should see a working debug page with environment information

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm run typecheck` to see remaining TypeScript errors
2. Fix test file mock issues if needed for testing
3. Verify all major application features are working correctly
