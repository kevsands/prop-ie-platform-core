## Application Startup Fixes

### Issues Fixed

- **Port Conflicts**: Implemented automatic detection and resolution of port conflicts in `dev-start.sh`
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: Fixed NEXTAUTH_URL inconsistency and added AWS configuration
- **Strict CSP Headers**: Modified Content Security Policy for development mode to prevent unnecessary blocks
- **React Version Conflicts**: Ensured consistent React 18.2.0 usage across the application
- **Type Definitions**: Updated TypeScript type definitions to match React version

### Improved Development Script

Enhanced `dev-start.sh` with:

- **Automated Diagnostics**: Port checking, dependency verification, and environment variable validation
- **Development Optimizations**: Simplified security components for development
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic cleanup of hanging processes
- **Configuration Management**: Proper next.config.js setup for development

## Component Documentation System

Implemented Storybook for component documentation:

- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Fully styled component previews with Tailwind support
- **Accessibility Testing**: Integrated a11y addon for automatic accessibility checking
- **Interactive Examples**: Playable stories with user interactions
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Stories for all major components with usage examples

### Documented Components

- **Form Components**: LoginForm, FormFieldComponent, AccessibleForm
- **UI Components**: Toast, ErrorBoundary, LoadingSkeleton
- **Accessibility Components**: ScreenReaderText, KeyboardFocusHandler

## Accessibility Enhancements

Added comprehensive accessibility improvements:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Added keyboard focus indicators and tab trapping
- **Screen Reader Support**: Implemented proper ARIA attributes and screen reader announcements
- **Form Validation**: Enhanced form error handling with accessible error messages
- **Skip Navigation**: Implemented skip-to-content link for keyboard users
- **Semantic HTML**: Improved HTML structure for better screen reader navigation

### Accessibility Audit Tool

Created a script for automated accessibility testing:

- **Automated Tests**: Checks pages against WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Detailed Reports**: Generates comprehensive reports of issues
- **Fix Suggestions**: Provides automated fix suggestions for common issues
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Can be integrated into CI pipeline

## Performance Optimizations

### Code Splitting

- **Route-Based Splitting**: Implemented lazy loading for routes
- **Component-Level Splitting**: Created LazyComponent utility for on-demand component loading
- **Optimized Bundling**: Configured webpack for better code splitting

### Performance Monitoring

Created a real-time performance dashboard for monitoring:

- **Web Vitals**: Tracks FCP, LCP, CLS, FID metrics
- **Resource Timing**: Monitors resource load times
- **Component Profiling**: Tracks component render performance
- **Memory Usage**: Monitors heap usage to prevent memory leaks

### Virtualized Lists

Implemented efficient rendering for large data sets:

- **VirtualizedList**: Only renders list items currently in viewport
- **VirtualizedGrid**: Grid-based virtualization for property listings
- **Lazy Loading**: Progressively loads images as they enter viewport

## Enhanced UX Features

- **Improved Forms**: Enhanced form validation and error handling
- **Loading States**: Added skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
- **Error Boundaries**: Implemented graceful error handling throughout the application
- **Toast Notifications**: Implemented an accessible toast notification system

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Component Testing**: Added Storybook tests for components
- **Accessibility Testing**: Automated a11y testing for all components
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Added tools for monitoring performance impact of changes

## Usage

### Running the Development Server

```bash
# Use the enhanced development script
./dev-start.sh

# Or run manually with
npm run dev
```

### Running Storybook

```bash
# Start Storybook dev server
npm run storybook

# Build static Storybook site
npm run build-storybook
```

### Running Accessibility Audit

```bash
# Run full accessibility audit
npm run a11y-audit

# Run audit in CI mode (non-interactive)
npm run a11y-audit:ci

# Run audit with automatic fix attempts
npm run a11y-audit:fix
```

## Future Improvements

- **RTL Support**: Add right-to-left language support
- **Color Contrast Tool**: Add tool for checking color contrast in design system
- **Advanced Animation**: Add smoother transitions between states
- **Offline Support**: Implement service workers for offline capabilities
- **Responsive Images**: Add responsive image handling for different screen sizes

## Contributing

When contributing to this project, please follow the established patterns for:

1. **Component Structure**: Follow the established component patterns
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure all components pass accessibility checks
3. **Performance**: Use code splitting and virtualization for large data sets
4. **Documentation**: Add stories for new components
