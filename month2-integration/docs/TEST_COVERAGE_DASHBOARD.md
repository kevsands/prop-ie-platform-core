# Test Coverage Dashboard Guide

This document provides an overview of the Test Coverage Dashboard, a tool for monitoring and improving test coverage across the application.

## Overview

The Test Coverage Dashboard is a visual representation of test coverage metrics for the project. It allows teams to:

1. Track overall test coverage at a glance
2. Monitor coverage trends over time
3. Identify modules and files with low coverage
4. Prioritize areas for improvement
5. Visualize progress as new tests are added

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+
- Jest test suite with coverage reporting enabled

### Generating the Dashboard

1. Run your tests with coverage:
   ```bash
   npm test -- --coverage
   ```

2. Generate the dashboard:
   ```bash
   node scripts/coverage-dashboard.js
   ```

3. To save historical data (recommended for tracking trends):
   ```bash
   node scripts/coverage-dashboard.js --save
   ```

4. To specify a custom output directory:
   ```bash
   node scripts/coverage-dashboard.js --output=./my-dashboard
   ```

5. Open the generated HTML file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open coverage-dashboard/index.html
   ```

## Dashboard Features

### Overall Coverage Metrics

The dashboard displays four key metrics:
- **Overall Coverage**: Combined metric of all coverage types
- **Statement Coverage**: Percentage of statements executed
- **Function Coverage**: Percentage of functions called
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of conditional branches executed

### Historical Trends

The dashboard includes line charts showing:
- Coverage metrics over time
- Module-specific coverage trends

These charts help visualize the impact of test improvements and identify patterns or regressions.

### Module Coverage

The module table shows:
- Coverage breakdown by module
- Number of files in each module
- Visual indicators for coverage levels

Modules are sorted with lowest coverage first to help prioritize improvements.

### Low Coverage Files

The dashboard highlights files with the lowest coverage:
- Displays the 20 files most in need of attention
- Provides detailed metrics for each file
- Helps teams focus testing efforts efficiently

## Integration with CI/CD

To include the dashboard in your CI/CD pipeline:

1. Add a step to your workflow file:
   ```yaml
   - name: Generate Test Coverage Dashboard
     run: |
       npm test -- --coverage
       node scripts/coverage-dashboard.js --save
   ```

2. Archive the dashboard as an artifact:
   ```yaml
   - name: Archive coverage dashboard
     uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
     with:
       name: coverage-dashboard
       path: coverage-dashboard/
   ```

## Team Usage Guide

### For Developers

- Review the dashboard before starting test improvements
- Focus on files relevant to your current work
- Aim to increase coverage in at least one low-coverage file with each sprint

### For Team Leads

- Use the dashboard in sprint planning to assign testing tasks
- Track coverage trends across releases
- Set incremental team goals for coverage improvement

### For QA Teams

- Identify areas with complex logic but low coverage
- Coordinate with developers on test strategy for critical modules
- Validate that new tests are effectively improving coverage

## Best Practices

1. **Don't chase 100% coverage blindly**
   - Focus on critical business logic and complex code
   - Some code may not need extensive testing (e.g., simple getters/setters)

2. **Use the trends to guide strategy**
   - Look for modules with declining coverage over time
   - Celebrate improvements and positive trends

3. **Balance quantity and quality**
   - High coverage with low-quality tests provides false confidence
   - Combine coverage metrics with other quality indicators

4. **Update regularly**
   - Generate and save the dashboard at least weekly
   - Review as a team during stand-ups or sprint retrospectives

## Troubleshooting

- **Empty dashboard**: Ensure tests are running with the `--coverage` flag
- **Missing history**: Make sure to use the `--save` flag to store historical data
- **Incorrect module grouping**: The dashboard groups by directory structure; consider reorganizing your code if the grouping isn't logical
