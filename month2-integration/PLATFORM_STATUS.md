# Platform Status Report

## Current Status

The platform is up and running at:
- Local: http://localhost:3000
- Network: http://192.168.0.41:3000

## Navigation Issue

If you're not seeing the navigation bar, this might be due to:

1. The HomePage component might have its own header that overrides the main navigation
2. Transparent navigation on the home page (it's set to be transparent until scrolled)
3. Browser cache issues

## Quick Fixes to Try

1. **Clear browser cache** and refresh the page
2. **Try other pages** that should show the navigation clearly:
   - http://localhost:3000/calculators
   - http://localhost:3000/documents
   - http://localhost:3000/transaction-flow

3. **Scroll down** on the homepage - the navigation might become visible after scrolling

## Working Features

- ✅ Calculators (mortgage, HTB, stamp duty)
- ✅ Document management
- ✅ Transaction flow visualization
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ Security middleware
