# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status
Based on the coverage dashboard, our current test coverage is:
- Overall: 67.39%
- By module:
  - API: 54.78% (Lowest)
  - Services: 58.13% (Second lowest)
  - Lib: 67.69%
  - Components: 75.17%
  - Context: 77.84%
  - Utils: 81.04%
  - Hooks: 84.76% (Highest)

## Goals
- Short-term (3 months): Improve overall coverage to 75%
- Medium-term (6 months): Achieve at least 70% coverage for all modules
- Long-term (12 months): Reach 80% overall coverage

## Priority Files
Based on the dashboard, these files need immediate attention:

| File | Coverage | Priority |
|------|----------|----------|
| src/api/file-7.ts | 46.28% | 1 |
| src/services/file-42.ts | 49.15% | 2 |
| src/api/file-36.ts | 50.25% | 3 |
| src/services/file-40.ts | 54.58% | 4 |
| src/api/file-26.ts | 55.13% | 5 |

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
1. Set up CI integration for the coverage dashboard
   - Configure GitHub Actions workflow to generate the dashboard
   - Add coverage reporting to all PRs
   - Implement coverage badges in README

2. Create testing documentation
   - Document testing patterns for API and services
   - Create examples for common testing scenarios
   - Set up guidelines for minimum coverage on new code

3. Fix highest-priority files
   - Add comprehensive tests for the top 5 files with lowest coverage
   - Focus on critical branches and edge cases

### Phase 2: Module Improvement (Weeks 5-12)
1. API Module
   - Create test plan for API routes
   - Implement test fixtures and mocks for API dependencies
   - Add tests focusing on error handling and edge cases

2. Services Module
   - Develop comprehensive testing for service layer
   - Create test utilities specific to service patterns
   - Address complex async flows with proper mocking

3. Library Module
   - Review and improve tests for critical library functions
   - Focus on performance-critical code paths
   - Ensure proper error handling coverage

### Phase 3: Integration and Maintenance (Ongoing)
1. Regular Review
   - Weekly review of coverage dashboard
   - Track progress against goals
   - Identify new problem areas quickly

2. Process Integration
   - Make coverage part of code review process
   - Ensure new code meets minimum coverage standards
   - Recognize team members who improve coverage

3. Automation
   - Block PRs that significantly decrease coverage
   - Automatically assign test tasks based on coverage
   - Generate weekly reports on coverage trends

## Specific Action Items

### Week 1
- [x] Set up coverage dashboard in CI
- [ ] Add tests for src/api/file-7.ts to improve coverage to at least 70%
- [ ] Update README with coverage badges

### Week 2
- [ ] Add tests for src/services/file-42.ts and src/api/file-36.ts
- [ ] Create test pattern documentation for API module
- [ ] Set up coverage gates in CI pipeline

### Week 3
- [ ] Add tests for remaining high-priority files
- [ ] Start systematic improvement of API module tests
- [ ] Establish coverage requirements for new code

### Week 4
- [ ] Review progress
- [ ] Adjust plan as needed
- [ ] Continue focus on API module improvement

## Resources Needed
- Testing time allocated each sprint (minimum 20% of development time)
- Test fixture and mock data preparation
- Documentation for complex systems to enable proper testing

## Tracking
Progress will be tracked through:
1. Weekly dashboard review
2. Monthly status updates
3. Coverage metrics in sprint reviews

## Success Criteria
- No module below 70% coverage
- Overall coverage at or above 75%
- No individual file below 60% coverage
- All new code maintains or improves existing coverage
