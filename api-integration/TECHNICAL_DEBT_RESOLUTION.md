# Technical Debt Resolution & Foundation Repair

This document outlines the steps to resolve technical debt and repair the foundation of the application.

## Day 1-2: Project Structure Cleanup

### Task 1.1: Run Cleanup Script to Remove JavaScript Duplicates

The codebase contains many duplicated files with both TypeScript (.ts/.tsx) and JavaScript (.js/.jsx) versions. We'll use the provided script to clean up these duplicates.

```bash
# Run the cleanup script to remove JavaScript duplicates
node cleanup-duplicates.js
```

### Task 1.2: Updated TypeScript Configuration

The `tsconfig.json` file has been updated with proper TypeScript configuration, including:

- Strict type checking
- Proper module resolution
- Path aliases
- Type definitions
- Additional compiler options for improved code quality

### Task 1.3: Organize Folder Structure for Consistency

Run the organization script to create a consistent folder structure:

```bash
# Run the organization script
node organize-codebase.js
```

This will:
- Create folders for hooks, utils, and component categories
- Copy hook files to the hooks directory
- Copy utility files to the utils directory

*Note: Files are copied rather than moved to prevent breaking imports. After updating your imports, you can safely delete the original files.*

## Day 3-5: Code Quality Improvements

### Task 2.1: TypeScript Type Definitions

- Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for your data models
- Use proper type annotations for function parameters and return values
- Minimize use of `any` type

### Task 2.2: Component Refactoring

- Break down large components into smaller, reusable ones
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper prop validation

### Task 2.3: Implement Error Handling

- Add proper error boundaries
- Implement consistent error handling patterns
- Add loading states for asynchronous operations

## Day 6-7: Testing and Documentation

### Task 3.1: Test Coverage

- Add unit tests for critical components
- Add integration tests for key user flows
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automatic testing

### Task 3.2: Documentation

- Add inline documentation for complex functions
- Create a comprehensive README
- Document the application's architecture and design decisions

## Next Steps

After implementing these changes, your application will have:

1. A clean, organized codebase
2. Improved type safety
3. Better error handling
4. More consistent code style
5. Better documentation

These improvements will make the codebase more maintainable, easier to understand, and less prone to bugs in the future.
