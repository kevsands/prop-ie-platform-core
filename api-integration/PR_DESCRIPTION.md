# Fix TypeScript errors in performance utilities

## Summary
This PR fixes TypeScript errors in the performance utilities, focusing on the following files:
- `src/utils/performance/index.ts`
- `src/utils/performance/withMemo.tsx`
- `src/utils/performance/optimizeComponent.tsx`
- `src/utils/performance/monitor.tsx`
- `src/utils/performance/react-cache-polyfill.tsx`
- `src/utils/performance/safeMemo.tsx`
- `src/utils/performance/lazyLoad.tsx`

## Changes
- Added fallback implementations for `startRenderTiming` and `endRenderTiming` methods in the `performanceMonitor` object
- Fixed React import pattern to use `import * as React` for better type compatibility
- Updated component patterns to eliminate TypeScript errors related to ref forwarding
- Simplified lazy component loading to avoid prop type incompatibilities 
- Improved type safety in URL handling in monitoring utilities
- Removed usages of `JSX.Element` in favor of `React.ReactElement`
- Fixed dependency types to work with TypeScript's type system

## Testing
- Verified changes with type checking (`tsc --noEmit`)
- Confirmed the `safeCache` tests are passing
- Validated that the components render correctly

## Additional Notes
These changes focus specifically on type compatibility and don't change the runtime behavior of the performance utilities. The functions will continue to work as before, but now with improved type safety.
