# Security Incident Response Plan

This document outlines the steps to be taken in case of a security incident in the PropIE application. All team members should be familiar with this plan and follow it promptly in the event of a security breach or suspicious activity.

## 1. Detection Phase

### Potential Detection Sources

- **Automated Monitoring**:
  - Client-side security monitoring reports
  - Server-side security logs
  - CI/CD security scans
  - Dependency vulnerability alerts

- **Manual Detection**:
  - User reports of suspicious behavior
  - Development team code reviews
  - Security testing findings
  - External security researcher reports

### Initial Assessment

When a potential security incident is detected:

1. **Document Initial Information**:
   - Date and time of detection
   - Source of detection (monitoring tool, user report, etc.)
   - Brief description of the suspicious activity
   - Suspected impact and scope

2. **Initial Classification** (to be refined later):
   - **Critical**: Production system breach, data exfiltration, destructive impact
   - **High**: Active intrusion, limited data access, partial functionality impact
   - **Medium**: Attempted but unsuccessful intrusion, minor data exposure
   - **Low**: Suspicious activity without evidence of compromise

3. **Immediate Notification**:
   - Security incident response team lead
   - Development team lead
   - Operations team lead (for production incidents)

## 2. Containment Phase

### Immediate Actions Based on Severity

#### For Critical/High Severity (Complete or Partial Production Impact):

1. **Emergency Response** (execute within 30 minutes of detection):
   - Deploy emergency Content Security Policy headers
   - Trigger client-side protection mechanisms
   - Temporarily disable compromised features or APIs
   - Block suspicious IP addresses or user accounts if applicable
   - Rotate affected access tokens/credentials
   - Consider temporary service degradation over insecure operation

2. **Isolation Measures**:
   - Isolate affected systems from network if possible
   - Remove compromised code or dependencies
   - Freeze deployment pipeline to prevent further spread

#### For Medium/Low Severity:

1. **Limited Response**:
   - Contain the issue in the affected environment
   - Implement focused security controls
   - Document evidence for investigation

### Evidence Collection

- Capture logs from all relevant sources before they rotate
- Take screenshots of suspicious activity
- Preserve browser console logs if applicable
- Export incident reports from monitoring systems
- Maintain timeline of events and actions taken

## 3. Eradication Phase

### Remove Root Cause

1. **Identify the source of the compromise**:
   - Malicious code in the codebase
   - Supply chain attack through dependencies
   - Stolen credentials or access tokens
   - Misconfiguration or security control failure

2. **Eliminate the root cause**:
   - Remove compromised dependencies
   - Fix vulnerable code
   - Correct misconfigurations
   - Close unnecessary access points

### Vulnerability Remediation

1. **Develop and test patches**:
   - Security fixes for identified vulnerabilities
   - Updated dependencies with security patches
   - Enhanced security controls

2. **Scanning and verification**:
   - Run full security scans against remediated code
   - Perform penetration testing for critical issues
   - Verify that the vulnerable access path is closed

## 4. Recovery Phase

### Restore Systems to Normal Operation

1. **System restoration**:
   - Deploy clean code builds from verified sources
   - Restore systems from clean backups if necessary
   - Use secure restore procedures

2. **Credential rotation**:
   - Change all access credentials as appropriate
   - Rotate API keys and tokens
   - Update secrets in secure storage

### Verification and Monitoring

1. **Deploy with enhanced monitoring**:
   - Implement additional logging
   - Set up real-time alerts for similar patterns
   - Increase scrutiny on affected components

2. **Verification testing**:
   - Validate system functionality
   - Verify security controls are operating correctly
   - Confirm logging and monitoring are functional

## 5. Lessons Learned Phase

### Post-Incident Analysis

1. **Conduct a retrospective meeting**:
   - Review the timeline of events
   - Analyze effectiveness of the response
   - Identify gaps in detection, response, or remediation
   - Document lessons learned

2. **Update security controls**:
   - Implement additional preventative measures
   - Update detection capabilities for similar attacks
   - Revise security policies if needed

### Documentation and Process Improvement

1. **Document the incident**:
   - Full timeline from detection to recovery
   - Technical details of the vulnerability and exploit
   - Effectiveness of the response
   - Recommended improvements

2. **Update response plan**:
   - Revise based on lessons learned
   - Update contact lists and escalation procedures
   - Refine detection and containment strategies

## Appendix B: Security Tool Quick Reference

### Emergency Response Tools

- **CSP Header Deployment**: Use Next.js config to deploy emergency CSP headers
  ```javascript
  // Emergency restrictive CSP
  {
    key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
    value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none';"
  }
  ```

- **Client-Side Protection**: Activate additional protection mode
  ```javascript
  // In ClientLayout.tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    if (window._securityMonitor) {
      window._securityMonitor.enableEmergencyMode();
    }
  }, []);
  ```

- **Feature Toggle**: Use feature flags to disable affected features

- **Log Collection**: Script to collect and export logs
  ```bash
  # Example log export command
  npm run export-security-logs
  ```

- **Dependency Check**: Verify clean dependencies
  ```bash
  npm ci --package-lock-only
  npm audit
  ```

This incident response plan should be reviewed and updated regularly as the application evolves and new security threats emerge.
