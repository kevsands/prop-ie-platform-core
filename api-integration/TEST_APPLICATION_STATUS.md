# Application Status Check

## Server Status
The Next.js development server appears to be running on port 3000, but there seems to be an issue with responses timing out.

## Pages Created
1. `/first-time-buyers` - Main first-time buyers page with HTB integration
2. `/test-htb` - HTB context testing page
3. `/status` - Application status page
4. `/simple-test` - Simple test page
5. `/debug` - Debug navigation page

## API Endpoints Created
1. `/api/htb/buyer/claims` - HTB claims creation endpoint
2. `/api/htb/buyer/claims/[id]` - HTB claim details endpoint
3. `/api/test` - Test API endpoint
4. `/api/ping` - Simple ping endpoint

## Components Created
1. `HTBCalculatorApp.tsx` - HTB calculator and application form
2. `HTBStatusViewer.tsx` - HTB claim status viewer
3. HTB Context provider with full state management

## Known Issues
- Commands are timing out when trying to access the application
- This could be due to:
  - Server configuration issues
  - Middleware blocking requests
  - Build or compilation errors

## To Manually Test
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3000/first-time-buyers
2. Check browser developer console for errors
3. Try accessing different pages listed above

## Next Steps
1. Check server logs for errors
2. Verify middleware configuration
3. Test in browser directly
4. Check for any blocking network issues
