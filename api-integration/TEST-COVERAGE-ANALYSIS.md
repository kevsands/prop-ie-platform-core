## 8. Test Examples and Patterns

### 8.1 Component Test Pattern

```typescript
// Login form test example
it('should handle successful sign in', async () => {
  // Mock successful sign in
  (signIn as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValueOnce({
    isSignedIn: true,
    nextStep: { signInStep: 'DONE' }
  });
  
  // Mock user data after sign in
  (getCurrentUser as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValueOnce({
    userId: 'user-123',
    username: 'test@example.com'
  });
  
  // Render component with auth provider
  render(
    <AuthProvider>
      <TestAuthConsumer />
    </AuthProvider>
  );
  
  // Initially unauthenticated
  expect(screen.getByTestId('auth-state')).toHaveTextContent('unauthenticated');
  
  // Perform login
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('login-button'));
  
  // Wait for authentication state to update
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByTestId('auth-state')).toHaveTextContent('authenticated');
  });
  
  // Check user info
  expect(screen.getByTestId('user-info')).toHaveTextContent('test@example.com');
});
```

### 8.2 Security Test Pattern

```typescript
// Authentication security test example
it('should protect against brute force attacks', async () => {
  // Mock rate limit detection on the third attempt
  mockAuth.signIn
    .mockRejectedValueOnce(new AuthError({ name: 'NotAuthorizedException', message: 'Incorrect username or password' }))
    .mockRejectedValueOnce(new AuthError({ name: 'NotAuthorizedException', message: 'Incorrect username or password' }))
    .mockRejectedValueOnce(new AuthError({ name: 'LimitExceededException', message: 'Attempt limit exceeded, please try after some time.' }));
  
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useAuth(), { wrapper });
  
  // Multiple failed login attempts
  await act(async () => { await result.current.signIn('test@example.com', 'wrong1'); });
  await act(async () => { await result.current.signIn('test@example.com', 'wrong2'); });
  await act(async () => { await result.current.signIn('test@example.com', 'wrong3'); });
  
  // Error should indicate temporary lockout without exposing details
  expect(result.current.error).toContain('attempt limit');
  expect(result.current.error).not.toContain('NotAuthorizedException');
});
```

### 8.3 End-to-End Test Pattern

```typescript
// Login E2E test example
it('should login successfully with valid credentials', () => {
  // Load test user data
  cy.fixture('users').then((users) => {
    const testUser = users.buyers[0];
    
    // Type valid credentials
    cy.get('[data-testid="email-input"]').type(testUser.email);
    cy.get('[data-testid="password-input"]').type(testUser.password);
    
    // Intercept API calls for login
    cy.intercept('POST', '**/api/auth/login').as('loginRequest');
    cy.intercept('GET', '**/api/users/me').as('getUserProfile');
    
    // Submit the form
    cy.get('[data-testid="login-button"]').click();
    
    // Wait for login API request
    cy.wait('@loginRequest').its('response.statusCode').should('eq', 200);
    
    // Check that user is redirected to dashboard after login
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
    
    // Check that the user name is displayed in the header
    cy.get('[data-testid="user-name"]').should('contain', testUser.name);
  });
});
```

## 9. Conclusion

The PropIE AWS App demonstrates a well-structured testing approach with comprehensive coverage across multiple test types. The application shows particular strength in AWS Amplify integration testing, security testing, and end-to-end user journey testing.

While the overall code coverage metrics are below targets, the critical paths related to authentication, security, and key user journeys have good coverage. The identified gaps in utility function coverage and error handling represent opportunities for improvement that can be addressed with targeted test additions.

Based on this assessment, the testing approach is sufficient for production deployment with the understanding that the recommended improvements should be addressed in subsequent iterations to strengthen the overall test coverage.

**Recommendations Summary:**
1. Focus on increasing function coverage for utility modules
2. Enhance error handling and edge case testing
3. Consider implementing visual regression testing
4. Add component-level accessibility testing

With these enhancements, the testing coverage would meet or exceed all targets, further strengthening the application's quality assurance capabilities.
