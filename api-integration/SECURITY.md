## Dependency Management & Supply Chain Security

### Package Management Configuration

We use strict NPM configuration for dependency management:

```
audit=true
fund=false
package-lock=true
save-exact=true
engine-strict=true
```

This ensures:
- Security audits run automatically
- Exact package versions are pinned
- Package-lock.json is always maintained

### Dependency Scanning

Automated dependency scanning occurs in multiple phases:

1. **Pre-commit**: `npm audit` runs before each commit
2. **CI/CD**: Full dependency scans in the pipeline
3. **Scheduled**: Weekly security scans via GitHub Actions

### Package Validation Process

We maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using CycloneDX:
```bash
npx @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm --output sbom.json
```

New dependencies require approval based on:
- GitHub stars, weekly downloads, and maintainer activity
- Vulnerability history and maintainer reputation
- Overall security posture

## Code Security & Static Analysis

### Security-focused ESLint Configuration

We use custom ESLint configurations with security plugins:
- `eslint-plugin-security`
- `eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized`

Security rules enforce best practices for:
- Preventing injection attacks
- Avoiding unsafe patterns
- Requiring proper validation

### Security-focused Code Reviews

Our code review process includes mandatory security checks for:
- Input validation completeness
- Proper output encoding
- Secure DOM operations
- Authentication and authorization
- Dependency safety

### Custom Security Scanners

In addition to ESLint, we use:
- njsscan for Node.js/Express-specific security issues
- Custom security-scan.js for detecting suspicious patterns

## Runtime Security Controls

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

We implement a strict CSP header that:
- Restricts script sources
- Prevents inline scripts
- Disables unsafe evaluations
- Protects against XSS attacks

```
default-src 'self'; 
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; 
connect-src 'self' https://*.amazonaws.com; 
img-src 'self' data: https:; 
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; 
font-src 'self' data:; 
object-src 'none'; 
frame-ancestors 'none'; 
base-uri 'self'; 
form-action 'self'; 
upgrade-insecure-requests;
```

### Additional Security Headers

We implement comprehensive security headers:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`

### Client-side Security Monitoring

We use a custom `useSecurityMonitor` hook that:
- Detects and logs suspicious DOM manipulations
- Monitors for malicious redirects
- Inspects network requests for suspicious patterns
- Reports violations to the security endpoint

## CI/CD Security Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks

Using Husky and lint-staged, we enforce:
- Security linting
- Dependency auditing
- Custom security scans

```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged && npm audit"
    }
  }
}
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

Our security workflow includes:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- SBOM generation
- Custom security pattern detection

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

Runtime security monitoring includes:
- Client-side security violation logging
- Real-time network request monitoring
- DOM manipulation detection
- Storage access monitoring

### Incident Response Plan

We have a comprehensive security incident response plan that covers:

1. **Detection**: Identifying and classifying security incidents
2. **Containment**: Steps to limit damage and isolate affected systems
3. **Eradication**: Removing the cause of the incident
4. **Recovery**: Restoring systems securely
5. **Lessons Learned**: Process improvement

Refer to [SECURITY-INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md](SECURITY-INCIDENT-RESPONSE.md) for the full plan.

## Security Best Practices for Developers

### Secure Coding Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs server-side
   - Use TypeScript types and Zod for schema validation
   - Never trust client-side validation alone

2. **Output Encoding**:
   - Use React's built-in XSS protection
   - Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
   - Never use `eval()` or similar functions

3. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Always validate permissions server-side
   - Use secure authentication tokens
   - Implement proper session management

4. **Secure Data Handling**:
   - Never log sensitive information
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Be careful with client-side storage

5. **Dependency Management**:
   - Only add approved dependencies
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Run audit checks regularly

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:
- Email: security@propie.example.com
- Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until resolved

We take all security reports seriously and will respond promptly.
