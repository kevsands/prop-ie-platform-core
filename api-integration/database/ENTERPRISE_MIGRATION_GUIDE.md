## 🚀 **Migration Phases**

### ✅ **Phase 1-5: Preparation (SAFE)**
**Status:** Ready to execute
**Risk Level:** Zero (no data modification)

```bash
# Execute migration preparation
npm run db:migration-prepare
```

**What it does:**
1. **Safety Checks** - Verifies system readiness
2. **Backup Creation** - Creates multiple safety backups
3. **PostgreSQL Testing** - Validates connection and permissions
4. **Schema Creation** - Builds enterprise database structure
5. **Final Validation** - Confirms readiness for data migration

### 🔄 **Phase 6: Data Migration (CONTROLLED)**
**Status:** Pending preparation completion
**Risk Level:** Minimal (original data preserved)

```bash
# Only after Phase 1-5 completion
npm run db:migrate-data
```

### 🎯 **Phase 7: Application Cutover (FINAL)**
**Status:** Pending data migration
**Risk Level:** Zero (immediate rollback available)

```bash
# Update application configuration
npm run db:switch-to-postgresql
```

---

## 🛠️ **Available Commands**

### **Safe Operations (Always Available)**
```bash
# Create complete backup of current data
npm run db:backup

# Test PostgreSQL connectivity
npm run db:test-postgresql

# Run full migration preparation
npm run db:migration-prepare
```

### **Migration Operations (After Preparation)**
```bash
# Execute data migration (Phase 6)
npm run db:migrate-data

# Switch application to PostgreSQL (Phase 7)
npm run db:switch-to-postgresql

# Rollback to SQLite (Emergency)
npm run db:rollback-to-sqlite
```
