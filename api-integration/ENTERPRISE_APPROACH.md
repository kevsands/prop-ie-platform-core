# Enterprise-Grade Schema Consolidation - Best Practices Approach

## ‚úÖ Why Start Fresh

**Problem with Previous Approach:**
- Making piecemeal changes to complex schema
- Risk of breaking existing functionality  
- Not following enterprise naming conventions consistently
- Attempting to consolidate without full system analysis

## üè¢ Enterprise-Grade Strategy

### Phase 1: Analyze & Document Current State
1. **Audit existing models** for business value and usage
2. **Identify true duplicates** vs complementary models
3. **Document integration points** and dependencies
4. **Plan consolidation strategy** with minimal breaking changes

### Phase 2: Clean Architecture Design
1. **Clear naming conventions** following enterprise standards
2. **Proper separation of concerns** (property vs financial vs buyer)
3. **Extensible design** for future requirements
4. **Performance considerations** with proper indexing

### Phase 3: Incremental Migration
1. **Add new models** alongside existing (not replacing)
2. **Validate each addition** before proceeding
3. **Update relations systematically**
4. **Deprecate old models** only after new ones are proven

## üéØ Enterprise Model Consolidation Plan

### Models That Should Be Consolidated:
- `SnagList` + `SnagListFTB` ‚Üí `PropertyInspection` (comprehensive inspection system)
- Multiple `Investment` concepts ‚Üí Clear separation by domain

### Models That Should Remain Separate:
- Property investments vs Development finance (different business domains)
- Buyer reservations vs Property reservations (different stakeholders)

### Naming Convention Standards:
- **Domain-Specific Prefixes**: `Property`, `Development`, `Buyer`, `Financial`
- **Clear Business Intent**: `PropertyInspection` not `SnagList`
- **Consistent Relations**: `propertyInspections` not `snagLists`

## üìã Quality Gates

Before any model changes:
1. ‚úÖ **Schema validates** without errors
2. ‚úÖ **Business logic preserved** from original models  
3. ‚úÖ **Relations properly defined** with appropriate constraints
4. ‚úÖ **Performance indexes** included where needed
5. ‚úÖ **Backward compatibility** maintained where possible

## Next Steps

1. **Complete business analysis** of existing models
2. **Design clean enterprise architecture**
3. **Implement with proper validation at each step**
4. **Create migration strategy** for existing data

**Enterprise Principle: Better to build it right than build it fast.**
