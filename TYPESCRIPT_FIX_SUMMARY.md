## Remaining Issues

There are still several TypeScript errors that need to be addressed:

1. **Import Path Issues**
   - Some components can't resolve '@/types/three-extensions'
   - Path resolution needs to be fixed in tsconfig.json or imports need to be updated

2. **JSX Syntax Errors**
   - Many components have JSX syntax errors, particularly in:
     - developer/projects/page.tsx
     - developer/prop-dashboard/page.tsx
     - developer/team/contractors/page.tsx

3. **Duplicate Variable Declarations**
   - BuyerJourney.tsx has duplicate isLoading declarations

4. **Missing Commas**
   - Many files have syntax errors with missing commas in object literals and parameter lists

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix Import Path Resolution**
   - Update tsconfig.json to ensure proper path resolution for '@/types/three-extensions'
   - Or update import paths to use relative paths

2. **Address Duplicate Variables**
   - Rename or merge duplicate variable declarations

3. **Fix JSX Syntax**
   - Systematically address JSX syntax errors, especially closing tags

4. **Address Missing Commas**
   - Use a code formatter like Prettier to fix syntax issues automatically

5. **Run Comprehensive Testing**
   - After fixing these issues, run thorough tests to ensure all functionality works as expected
