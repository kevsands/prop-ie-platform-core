### Non-Critical Warnings ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Database connection warnings (expected in build environment)
- Amplify client deprecation warnings
- metadataBase property warnings
- Edge runtime warnings

### Remaining Technical Debt üìã
- 831 TypeScript errors (with strict mode disabled)
- 0.36% test coverage
- 14 security vulnerabilities
- Performance monitoring needs client-only implementation

## Build Output Summary

```bash
‚úì Compiled successfully
‚úì Generating static pages
‚ö† Database warnings (expected)
‚ö† Deprecation warnings (non-blocking)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create proper environment variables
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Add database connection string
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Address Warnings** (Optional)
   - Update deprecated imports
   - Configure metadataBase
   - Migrate to new patterns

4. **Improve Code Quality**
   - Enable TypeScript strict mode gradually
   - Add basic test coverage
   - Fix security vulnerabilities

## Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ Build completes without fatal errors
- ‚úÖ Application can be deployed
- ‚úÖ Development server can start
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings present but non-blocking
- ‚ùå Test coverage still insufficient
- ‚ùå TypeScript strict mode disabled

## Conclusion

The PropIE AWS Application is now in a **buildable state**. The most critical issues preventing the build have been resolved. The remaining warnings and technical debt can be addressed incrementally without blocking development or deployment.
