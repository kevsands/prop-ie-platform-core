## ðŸš€ Immediate Deployment Plan

### Step 1: DNS Configuration
```bash
# Add CNAME records to prop.ie DNS:
staging.prop.ie    â†’    CNAME    â†’    AWS Amplify URL
demo.prop.ie       â†’    CNAME    â†’    AWS Amplify URL
beta.prop.ie       â†’    CNAME    â†’    AWS Amplify URL
```

### Step 2: AWS Amplify Setup
```bash
cd /path/to/prop-ie-aws-app-PERFECT-WORKING-JUNE13-2025

# Configure staging environment
npm run setup:amplify

# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Configure custom domains in AWS Amplify Console
```

### Step 3: Environment Configuration
Create `.env.staging`:
```bash
# Staging Environment
NODE_ENV=staging
