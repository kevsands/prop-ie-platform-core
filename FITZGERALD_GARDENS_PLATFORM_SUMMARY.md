# Fitzgerald Gardens Platform Implementation

## Overview
We've successfully implemented a single-company platform for Prop (Fitzgerald Gardens Residential Ltd) focusing on the Fitzgerald Gardens development.

## What We Built

### 1. Authentication & Routing
- Fixed authentication to redirect developers to `/developer` instead of `/dashboard`
- Skipped onboarding flow to focus on core functionality
- Role-based routing for future extensibility

### 2. Database Schema
- Created comprehensive development schema in `prisma/schema.prisma` including:
  - Developments
  - Unit Types (1-4 bed)
  - Individual Units
  - Schedule of Accommodation
  - Amenities
  - Viewings
  - Reservations
  - Sales
  - Documents & Media

### 3. API Routes
- `/api/developer/developments` - List all developments
- `/api/developer/developments/[id]` - Get/update specific development
- `/api/developer/developments/[id]/units` - Manage units
- `/api/developer/developments/[id]/units/[id]` - Individual unit management

### 4. Developer Dashboard
- Created `/developer/developments/[id]/page.tsx` with:
  - Overview tab showing unit types and schedule of accommodation
  - Units tab for managing individual units
  - Viewings tab for managing property viewings
  - Documents tab for brochures, price lists, etc.
  - Analytics tab (placeholder for future charts)
