# Application Status Report

## Completed Tasks ✅

1. **Fixed navigation icon initialization error**
   - Wrapped icon imports in a function to ensure proper initialization
   - Component now loads without initialization errors

2. **Development server runs successfully**
   - Server starts on port 3000 (or 3001 if occupied)
   - No critical runtime errors in development mode

3. **Audited TypeScript errors**
   - Identified all TypeScript compilation errors
   - Many related to test mocks and third-party library imports

4. **Fixed React Query import errors**
   - Resolved module resolution issues with @tanstack/react-query
   - Modified tsconfig.json to use proper module resolution

5. **Fixed Three.js import errors**
   - Updated imports to work correctly with Three.js namespace
   - Modified code to access classes via the namespace

6. **Fixed useSearchParams Suspense issue**
   - Wrapped component using useSearchParams in Suspense boundary
   - Resolved Next.js 15 CSR bailout error

## Pending Issues ⚠️

### High Priority

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Build process attempts to connect to "propie_test" database
   - Database doesn't exist or configuration is incorrect
   - Need to set up proper environment configuration

2. **Client/Server Component Mismatches**
   - Performance monitor cannot be accessed from server components
   - Need to ensure proper component boundaries
   - Create clear separation between client and server code

3. **Navigation Provider Errors**
   - Some pages expect NavigationProvider wrapper
   - Need to properly implement context providers in app layout

4. **Performance Monitor Server Access**
   - Client-only modules being accessed from server components
   - Need to refactor to ensure proper module boundaries

### Medium Priority

5. **Mock/Test Type Errors**
   - Many TypeScript errors in test files
   - Prisma mock types not matching expected interfaces
   - Need to update test mocks to match actual types

6. **Authentication Flow Integration**
   - Need to verify auth flow works correctly
   - Ensure proper routing based on user roles

7. **API Integrations**
   - Verify Amplify integration
   - Check database connections
   - Ensure all APIs are properly configured

## Next Steps

1. **Set up environment configuration**
   - Create proper .env files
   - Configure database connections
   - Set up necessary API keys

2. **Fix build errors**
   - Address client/server component issues
   - Fix context provider wrapping
   - Ensure database connections work

3. **Production readiness**
   - Complete type error fixes
   - Test authentication flows
   - Verify all API integrations

## Current State

- ✅ Development server runs
- ✅ Basic navigation works
- ⚠️ Production build fails
- ⚠️ Database connections not configured
- ⚠️ Some client/server boundary issues

The application is in a partially working state - development mode works but production build requires fixes for database connections and client/server component boundaries.
