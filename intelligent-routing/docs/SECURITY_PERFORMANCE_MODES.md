# Security Performance Modes

This document describes the different security performance modes available in the application and their implications.

## Available Modes

The security system supports the following performance modes:

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `strict` | Maximum security with comprehensive checks | High-value or security-critical operations |
| `balanced` | Default mode with optimized security-performance tradeoff | Most application operations |
| `performance` | Reduced security checks for better performance | Performance-critical, lower-risk operations |
| `high-performance` | Minimal security checks for maximum performance | Very high throughput, minimal risk operations |

## Mode Selection Guidelines

### Strict Mode

- Apply for authentication, financial transactions, and sensitive data operations
- Includes deep pattern analysis, comprehensive threat detection
- Highest security guarantee with potential performance impact

### Balanced Mode (Default)

- Suitable for most application operations
- Optimized security-performance balance
- Provides strong security with reasonable performance 

### Performance Mode

- Use for operations where performance is critical
- Reduces security check depth while maintaining essential protections
- Suitable for frequently used, less sensitive operations

### High-Performance Mode

- Use for extremely performance-sensitive operations or bulk processing
- Only performs minimal security checks
- Should be used only for low-risk operations with high volume

## Implementation Details

Security performance modes affect:

1. **Validation Depth** - How extensively input data is validated
2. **Threat Detection** - Level of threat analysis performed
3. **Caching Strategy** - How security results are cached
4. **Pattern Matching** - Number and complexity of security patterns checked

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Using high-performance mode for bulk operations
const validatedRecords = validateSecurityInput(
  bulkDataSchema,
  recordBatch,
  {
    performanceMode: 'high-performance',
    context: { operation: 'bulk-import' }
  }
);

// Using strict mode for financial transactions
const validatedTransaction = validateSecurityInput(
  financialTransactionSchema,
  transaction,
  {
    performanceMode: 'strict',
    context: { operation: 'payment' }
  }
);
```

## Performance Impact

| Mode | Relative Performance | Security Coverage |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| `strict` | 1x (baseline) | 100% |
| `balanced` | 2-3x faster | ~90% |
| `performance` | 5-10x faster | ~75% |
| `high-performance` | 20-50x faster | ~40% |

## Notes

- Always use the most secure mode appropriate for the operation
- The default `balanced` mode is suitable for most operations
- Custom validation rules can be added to any mode
- Security logs will indicate which mode was used for each operation
