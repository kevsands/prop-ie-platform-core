### 1.2 Security Components

The security architecture comprises the following key components:

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Security Service | `src/lib/security/index.ts` | Centralized security management |
| Authentication | `src/lib/amplify/auth.ts` | User authentication and authorization |
| API Protection | `src/lib/security/apiProtection.ts` | Secure API requests |
| Content Security | `src/lib/security/sanitize.ts` | Prevent XSS and injection attacks |
| Threat Detection | `src/lib/security/threatDetection.ts` | Identify security threats |
| Security Monitoring | `src/lib/security/useSecurityMonitor.ts` | Real-time security monitoring |

| Session Security | `src/lib/security/sessionFingerprint.ts` | Session hijacking protection |
| Error Handling | `src/lib/security/errorHandling.ts` | Security-focused error handling |

### 1.3 Security Configuration

The security module supports multiple configuration options to adapt security measures to different environments:

```typescript
// Sample security configuration
{
  environment: 'production',
  logLevel: AuditSeverity.WARNING,
  performanceMode: 'balanced',

5. **CSRF Verification**: Enhance CSRF implementation with double-submit cookie pattern for additional security.

6. **Geolocation Service**: Replace the mock geolocation service with a production implementation.

### 8.3 Low Priority Recommendations

7. **Dependency Management**: Implement more comprehensive dependency security scanning.

8. **Threat Detection Enhancement**: Fully implement the threat detection module that appears to be simplified.

9. **Security Testing**: Expand security-focused testing coverage.

10. **Security Documentation**: Enhance security documentation with implementation details and examples.

## 9. Compliance Considerations

The application's security implementation addresses key requirements for:

- **GDPR**: Data protection measures for EU data subjects
- **PCI DSS**: Protection of payment-related information
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protections against common web vulnerabilities

## 10. Conclusion

The PropIE AWS App demonstrates a robust, well-architected security implementation that addresses key web application security concerns. The security architecture leverages AWS Amplify v6 capabilities while extending them with custom enhancements for comprehensive protection.
