## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Simplified authentication flow
1. User logs in via /login
2. AuthContext validates credentials
3. Role-based routing to appropriate dashboard
4. Protected routes enforce access control
5. Session persisted in localStorage/cookies
```

### Data Flow Architecture
```typescript
// Component → Hook → Service → API flow
Component (UI) 
  → Custom Hook (useProperty)
    → Service Layer (PropertyService)
      → API Client (GraphQL/REST)
        → Backend Services
```

### State Management
- **Global State**: React Context (AuthContext, UserRoleContext)
- **Component State**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Server State**: React Query (planned implementation)
- **Form State**: Custom form hooks with validation

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Security**
