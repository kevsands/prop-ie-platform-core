# Roles Array Fix Summary

## Issue
The authentication system was incorrectly accessing a single `role` property on User objects, but the Prisma schema defines `roles` as an array of UserRole enums.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `/src/app/api/auth/permissions/route.ts`
- Changed from accessing `user.role` to `user.roles`
- Updated response to return `roles` array instead of single `role`
- Added logic to merge permissions from multiple roles
- Special handling for ADMIN role (if present, only admin permissions are used)

### 2. Updated `/src/services/authService.ts`
- Modified `TokenPayload` interface to use `roles: UserRole[]` instead of `role: UserRole`
- Updated `generateTokens` method to pass `roles` array in JWT payload
- Fixed `checkPermission` method to iterate through all user roles
- Updated `register` method to convert single role to array and use correct field names

### 3. Updated `/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`
- Changed User interface to use `roles: string[]` instead of `role: string`
- Updated `hasRole` method to check if role exists in array
- Renamed and updated `getPermissionsForRole` to `getPermissionsForRoles` to handle multiple roles
- Added permission merging logic for multiple roles

### 4. Created New Files
- `/src/types/auth-types.ts` - Type definitions for authentication with proper roles array handling
- `/test-roles-fix.js` - Test script to verify roles handling

## Key Improvements
1. **Consistent Role Handling**: All auth-related code now correctly handles roles as an array
2. **Permission Merging**: When a user has multiple roles, permissions are properly combined
3. **Admin Override**: If a user has the ADMIN role, they get full permissions regardless of other roles
4. **Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript types to ensure consistent usage

## Migration Notes
- Existing single `role` values in the database should be migrated to `roles` arrays
- JWT tokens will need to be updated to include roles array
- Client code accessing `user.role` should be updated to use `user.roles`

## Testing
Run the test script to verify the implementation:
```bash
node test-roles-fix.js
```
